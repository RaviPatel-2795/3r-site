			<h2 style="color:#00627e;">Your Edge in Payment Management</h2>
			<p>Our merchant service terminals are easy to install and also easy to use. We offer both countertop plug in terminals or portable terminals. You choose which one is more suited to your business style. <a href="http://www.3rtelecom.co.uk/services.html">Installation and training</a> are provided free of charge to help you get the most out the terminal. With our portable terminals you can serve all day on a single charge meaning sales can keep rolling in. Our terminals also provide your customers with the option of contactless payment from all major credit & debit cards. If your terminal breaks down we will send out a new terminal the next working day so you won’t lose out on any transactions. We provide secure, fast, reliable payments meaning you can take payments stress free.
			<p>It is a requirement that you are PCI Complaint, the complaint fee is £4.99+ VAT per month. If you are not compliant you may be liable for additional penalties from the Acquirer (The Bank). Please check your monthly merchant service statement. Should you feel that you are not compliant please call 3R and we will be happy to guide you. If you are not enrolled to be compliant, the Bank will automatically opt you in a ‘Pro Activity Service ‘which will cost you £15.00+ VAT per month. This is an optional service which you can opt out of at any time. Having this service in place means that they will take care of the full PCI Compliant procedure on your behalf. 3R can provide PCI for you for £4.99+ VAT per month. Please be vigilant of door-step fraudsters’ who may come into your store and ask for a Supervisor pin or Supervisor card. We strongly suggest you do not provide this to them as it will allow them to process a refund plus override transactions. There are also fraudsters processing ‘Keyed & Signed’ transactions – do not allow this to happen as you may be liable for the chargeback of this if it is not a genuine transaction. The Bank nor 3R would never come into your business unannounced and ask for such things. If anyone does, then please refuse and if you are concerned please call either the Bank or call 3R on 01992 574650. We would also like you to be vigilant of door-step sellers. You may be offered a minimum of a 4-5 year contract with no cooling off period where prices may vary and increase drastically. They may also pressure you to sign the contract there and then to secure the ‘special price’. Do not hesitate to contact 3R if you are having any doubts.

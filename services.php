									<h3>Technical Support</h3>
									3R Telecom has a dedicated technical support team to help you realise the full potential of your till, minimise costly downtime and support users. Our technical staff are very knowledgeable in all things EPOS and pride themselves on delivering a friendly and professional experience. The team is based in the UK.
									<br>
									<br>The technical team is responsible for till configuration, customisation and user EPoS training. Configuration can take place before the till is delivered, based on a completed survey of options and products required. It is also available remotely via LogMeIn, which gives us full access to your till upon request (and authorisation). Customisation refers to UI changes, bespoke reports etc. and can also be performed on or off-site depending on how much information is provided beforehand. User training, walk-throughs and workshops can be provided at your convenience and is included as part of your support agreement.
									<br>
									<br>Critical support issues whereby the system is offline will be handled by our technical support team; if the issue cannot be resolved we will swap out your system on the next working day. This is part of the support agreement and is there to offer peace-of-mind when using your till to minimise revenue loss.

									<h3>EPOS Configuration</h3>
									Successful configuration of your EPOS system for your industry and business needs is our primary goal. This can either be by educating the business owner, or relevant members of staff, or by using 3R Telecomâ€™s configuration team to make the process as straight forward as possible. This could also be achieved by collaboration between us depending on user experience, resource constraints or budget.
									<br>
									<br>Our EPOS software is pre-configured with over 30,000 products and is ready to go for most convenience shops. Additional configuration may be required due to discounts, bulk buys, special offers, barcodes etc. With this in mind, your EPOS till should arrive ready to start trading immediately.
									<br>
									<br>If you have existing customers we can load their details into the EPOS system with the sales history accumulated over the years.
									<br>
									<br>During the EPoS installation, we offer basic free training on how to use your EPoS till which includes catalogue maintenance. If however you would like 3R Telecom to take care of your products for you; this service is charged at our normal consulting rate. The cost of which will be depending on the number and complexity of products required.

									<h3>EPOS Installation</h3>
									3R Telecom offers free professional installation by our experienced installation team (within the UK mainland). You also have the option of a self-service installation as our complete systems can be shipped via courier.
									<br>
									
									<br>For smaller installations where minimal configuration is needed, the EPOS system can be delivered by courier to anywhere in the UK*. Since the till will be configured and ready to go, it simply needs plugging in and switching on.
									<br>
									<br>Our tills come installed with LogMeIn which is a remote desktop software which allows us to provide support and training from our offices. For tills delivered by courier, we offer training via LogMeIn as part of your support agreement to get you familiar with your new system. This is ideal as you can choose when to be trained at your convenience.
									<br>
									<br>We would recommend installation of multiple tills to be done by our professional installation team. This ensures all devices are linked correctly in the most appropriate manner. Support issues raised which are due to poor installation can and may be charged at our standard consulting rate; over and above youâ€™re the support contract.
									<br>
									<br>If you have any queries about the EPoS installation and whether an on-site or self-service installation would suit you, then please contact us.

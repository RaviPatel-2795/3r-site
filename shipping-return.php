			<h2>SHIPPING</h2>
				<p>We currently offer two types of delivery methods: TNT Express or Interlink Express; depending on what suits you, and what products you have purchased.
				</p>
				<p>Delivery by TNT is based solely on product weights. TNT Express is a next day delivery service between 9am-5pm. The following table is the rates charged based on weight categories. Prices are shown excluding VAT.
				</p>
				<p>
				<br><b>Weight &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fixed Price &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Price per KG</b>
				<br>1-10KG &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp £9.99 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp £0.00
				<br>11-20KG &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp £15.99 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp £0.00
				<br>21-100KG &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp £0.00 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp £0.50

			<h3>On-Site Installation</h3>
				<p>When ordering a complete EPOS system, there is an option to have the till installed by our expert installation team. The delivery charge will be reduced to zero when selecting On-Site Installation. Any other items added to an order with an on-site delivery will also be delivered with the till, therefore incur zero delivery charge when checking out.
				</p>
										
			<h2>RETURNS</h2>
